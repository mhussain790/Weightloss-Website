    <h2>What can you do without getting a Gym Membership?</h2>

<p>What if you don't want to get a Gym membership, can't afford one, or just have other reasons? There are some days where we just
  don't have the time or get preoccupied, and the gym ends up closing before we can get there. Here are some of the things we do to
  get a quick cardio or workout session in!</p>

  <ol>
    <b><li>HIIT Cardio at Home</li></b><br>

<p>This is probably the best form of cardio to do in our opinion.
You can burn so many calories in a short period of time with HIIT cardio, which stands for <b>H</b>igh <b>I</b>ntensity <b>I</b>nterval <b>T</b>raining.
Basically, you do a full on sprint/100% effort for a short period and then go 10% effort/rest for a longer period.
That makes up one round and a good session would be anywhere from 5-7 rounds. This can be done with any exercise.
You can do it on a cardio machine, swimming, running, etc. The most effective and quickest method is jump roping.</p>

<p>You’ll definitely feel HIIT Cardio at the end! And if you're interested in how to count calories burned outside of the gym then click the button to take a look!</p>

<br>
<div class="well">
Example:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <b><h4>Jump Rope</h4></b><br>

		<li><p>30-45 seconds of Jump Roping as fast as possible.</p></li>

		<li><p>1 minute to 1 minute and 30 seconds of rest.</p></li>

	<b><h4>Treadmill/StairMaster/Elliptical</h4></b><br>

		<li><p>30-45 of Running/Climbing as Fast as possible on a higher resistance setting.</p></li>

		<li><p>1-1:30 of slow walking/climbing (low-lowest resistance possible)</p></li>
</ul>

<b><li>Go Outside!</li></b><br>

<p>This might be the most obvious but it also works with #3 and #4 on our list. So keep that in mind as well!</p>

<p>Just going outside for a 10-15 minute walk can really do a lot for you health wise. Even taking your dog on a walk can help.
   Walking even a short distance will burn calories. If we take it up a notch and go for a 10 minute slow-paced jog then you'll be burning even more calories. Also,
  going for a run or even hiking if you have hiking trails would be a good option as well.</p>

<b><li>Reward yourself!</li></b><br>

  <p>In order to to get in a good habit of going outside, we recommend you start off by going for short walks. For instance, going down the street or a couple light posts the first day.
    Then, going a street and a half the next day. If you jog or run down there, then you can finish it faster! Something that we push at Get Fit is rewarding yourself after completing tasks.
  Let's say you bing watch a series on Netflix or a new episode of your favorite show came out. You can only watch an episode if you complete a task. So if we walk that day than we can watch the show
after. You'll have to push yourself in the beginning to get yourself to do them, but it gets very easy after a few times. This is a method we use to stop <b>laziness</b>. </p>


<b><li>Find a Friend to Exercise with!</li></b>
<br>

<p>How often do you hold yourself accountable for things like skipping workout days or eating an extra donut? In order to maximize your benefits, it's a big help to have a friend
  help you in your journey. From taking small walks together to hiking mountain trails together. Even having them text you if you hit your goal for today or ask you what you're
  eating for lunch that day. It makes that feeling of success that much greater when you hit your goal!</p>


  <b><li>Sports/Join a class!</li></b><br>

<p>So running is not your cup of tea, but you’d still like to exercise in some other way. There are many different sports out there that might fit you. From swimming and volleyball to soccer and basketball,
there are various activities you can partake in. An easy way to get involved in these sports is through your nearest Recreation or Civic Center. Many Rec. Centers have gyms, basketball courts, pools, etc. nowadays and their membership fees are not too expensive ($20-30 a month).
They also hold various classes in swimming, yoga, and dance, or sports leagues like soccer and basketball. </p>

<p>Another great way to get exercise is to join a class. By this we mean something like martial arts. One of our admins has a Black Belt in Shorinji-Ryu Karate and he writes:</p>

<i><p>As a kid, I practiced Karate at a dojo where I received my black belt. Even though I was a 14 year old kid at the time, there were
  a lot adults practicing. Martial arts like Karate aren’t just for kids. The adult class at Karate kicked my ass quite a few times.
  My teacher incorporated a lot of P90x and Insanity exercises for abs/core into this routine as well. </p></i>

  <p>Nowadays, a lot of people are taking MMA classes. No matter what you take MMA, Karate, Boxing, etc. you’re also learning self-defense.
  Not many people can say they know some type of Martial Art especially saying they know self-defense techniques.
  We highly recommend checking Yelp and even Facebook reviews of what some people say. Watch out for something called <b>McDojo’s</b> where the school hands
  out belts, regardless of a student’s performance, just to make money. </p>

  <p>Many schools have a free class you can take or free trial to see how it’s like.
  One important thing to remember is, let the teacher know what your goals are or what you mainly want out of the class.
  This will help your teacher point you toward the class that will fit your needs or they’ll add things into the curriculum that coincides with your interests.</p>
<br>

<p>Remember, whatever you decide to you is totally up to you. You have the total freedom to base your routine on yourself!</p>
