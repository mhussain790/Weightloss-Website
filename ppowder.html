  </div>

  <div id="content">
<p>
Protein is a very important nutrient in our daily intake. Regardless if you're bulking or cutting, you'll need to eat
quite a lot of protein to hit your Macronutrient goals.  Your numbers may be anywhere from your Lean Body Mass (LBM)
to your body weight in grams.
</p>

<h1>Why take Whey Protein Powder?</h1>

<p>You can hit your goals by eating a lot of meat that varies from chicken breast to ground turkey, and even some steak here and there.
  One of the main sources of protein people take in is Egg Whites. However, one serving from a carton of egg whites or an egg has absolute
  4 to 5 grams of protein. So you'll need to eat A LOT of servings of Eggs or Egg Whites to put a good dent in your protein Macro numbers.
  There's nothing wrong with getting all your protein through food sources. We highly recommend it!</p>

  <p>But what if you're busy...? Maybe you don't have time to be cooking during the day or forget to meal prep over the weekend. So what can you do?
    Protein powder is a very good way to hit your daily Macronutrient numbers. One serving can have anywhere from 20 to 25 grams of protein. Add in 2 scoops, maybe even 3,
    and you're at almost 80 grams of protein in one shake.</p>

    <h3>But Protein Powder tastes horrible... </h3>

    <div align="center"?

    <!-- Ad #1 -->
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:inline-block;width:320px;height:100px"

    <p>Yes, there are a lot of protein powder brands that offer their protein in different flavors, but they taste absolutely horrible. We've had a wide range of experience with Jay Robb protein that
      you've seen at grocery stores to even GNC brand protein powder. They all have one thing in common: they all taste like crap!
      And adding 2 to 3 scoops strengthens the flavor.</p>

      <h3>What's the best flavor of protein powder?</h3>
        <p>We've been in your shoes. The point where you've worked out or it's the end of the day and you need to hit your Protein Macro numbers. However, the thought of taking a protein
          shake that tastes like sewage is very disheartening. Well, we recommend Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein in Double Rich Chocolate and MTS Machine Whey Protein - Gourmet Cookies and Cream. Now, not all of Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein taste good.
          We've had Vanilla and Cookie's N' Cream, which we almost puked back up, and they're actually quite bad.</p>

          <p>Double Rich Chocolate is a pretty easy tasting chocolate flavor. If you take your shakes with milk then it almost tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Also, taking 2 to 3 scoops does NOT ruin
            the flavor to the point where you're gagging like other protein powder. It also only has about 2 grams of Carbohydrates and 1 gram of Fat per serving. So if you're trying to find a Protein Powder with High Protein, but low Fat and Carb macros then
          this is a good choice for you. The one downside is that the it's priced just under $60 for a 5 lb tub at most retailers. We've found it on Amazon for around $57.</p>

          </iframe></center>

          <p>MTS's Cookies and Cream is probably the BEST flavor protein powder on the market in our opinion. This is one flavor of protein powder that does justice to its name. The flavor
            actually tastes like Cookies and Cream without a horrible aftertaste. We think you'll actually look forward to taking your shakes with MTS's whey protein. It's also sold a cheaper
           price than Optimum's, at $55 for a 5 lb tub. There are a few downsides to this product though:

           <br>

            <ol>
              <li>They run out of stock QUICK!</li>
              <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>It's so popular that the main retailer that sells it, Tiger Fitness, runs out of stock very quick.</li>
                  <li>Amazon has it for around $63 if you want to spend the extra $10</li>
                </ul>
              <br>
              <li>Each serving has 3.5 grams of Fat and 6 grams of Carbs</li>
              <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Macros are different for each flavor</li>
                  <li>Might have a few more calories than other brands</li>
                  <li>However, it sounds like a good tradeoff for one of the best tastes</li>
                </ul>
