        <h3>
          Step One
        </h3>
        <p>You've decided to pursue your weightloss journey, but there are a few things you need before you begin.
          <br>
          <br>

          <h1>First, find someone who can hold you accountable.</h1>
          <br>
          <br>

          <p>What do I mean by this? I'm not trying to discourage you but there might be times where you'll mess up
          on your diet. Times where you'll want to order that pizza or go out to get ice cream. I've been there A LOT.
          Believe me, you'll have cravings and you can substitute food to meet those cravings, but sometimes they're not enough.
          I know this is really negative, but bear with me...

          By having someone who can hold you accountable (I.E. your wife, husband, girl/boyfriend, best-friend, etc.) you can have
          someone helping you get there. For my girlfriend, I'm always asking her questions or say things such as:</p>


          <div class="well">
          How much did you weigh in today?<br>
          Did you log your food you ate?<br>
          Did you weight your food out?<br>
          Did you have a cheat meal?<br>

          You're looking really good!<br>
          Come on just stick with it, you're almost there!<br>

          During workouts:<br>

          Just one more set!<br>
          Come on just one more rep!<br>
          Babe, just one more and you're done. (Then I make her do one more set, haha.)
        </div>

          <p>This person is someone who'll give you a push at times when you really need it. If you're younger and live with your parents then
          tell your parents something like this, "Mom, Dad... I really want to lose weight and I would like you guys to help me by buying less
          junk food and making healthier food, but also to push me into reaching my goal!" They can be your gym buddy as well, who can push you in the gym.

          Remember people won't make fun of you or judge you because you want to lose weight and get into better shape. By having someone there to keep you
          going a long the way, you're improving your chances for success.</p>
          <br>

          <h1>Second, let's set a few goals:</h1>

          <h2>Ultimate Goal</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>What is your ultimate goal? In other words, where do you see yourself weight-wise at the end of your
            journey or after a period of time. For example, I'm at 195 lbs right now and I'd like to lose 25 lbs by the end
            of 4 months. So my <strong>Ultimate Goal</strong> would be:

              Ultimate Goal: LOSE 25 lbs in 4 months.
            </p>

            <h2>Goal #1<h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Now let's set a smaller goal that's easier to reach. If you just focus on your end goal then you might get
                lost a long the way if you don't see results fast enough. So by having smaller goals, they fuel us into pushing
                ourselves more and more. That feeling of accomplishment after meeting a goal is really one of the most important
                factors in helping us complete our journey.

                Personally, I'd like to gain flexibility to where I can bend down and touch my toes. So my goal will be to touch my toes
                and hold that position for 60 seconds without too much discomfort. I recommend choosing something feasible for this goal.
                Something that's not too far out or will surprise you by taking longer than expected.

                Goal #1: Forward bend to touch toes. Holding for 60 seconds. Time: 2 weeks!

                Why 2 weeks?

                This part relies on you. You know your body better than anyone so I won't be able to tell you how long to set your time limit
                to. If you're starting out then I'd say think of a time limit and add a little bit more on to it, just to be safe.
              </p>

              <h2>Goal #2</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>So this is going to be a simpler goal. For this one I want you to choose a weight and a date you'd like to hit that weight at.
                For example, I'm starting out wanting to lose weight so I'd like to lose about 3 pounds by the end of week 2. I recommend staying between
                3-5 lbs just because you'll be surprised at how much weight you'll lose if you stick to your diet for 2 weeks. I use the 2 week
                period to tell:

                1) If my diet is working.
                  <li>If not then I need to adjust this through nutrition or excercise</li>

                2) How far did I progress?</p>
