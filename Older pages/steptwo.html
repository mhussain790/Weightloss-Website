          <br>
          <h3>Ultimate Goal</h3>
          <hr>
          What is your ultimate goal? In other words, where do you see yourself weight-wise at the end of your
            journey or after a period of time. For example, I'm at 195 lbs right now and I'd like to lose 25 lbs by the end
            of 4 months. So my <strong>Ultimate Goal</strong> would be:
            <br>
            <br>
              Ultimate Goal: LOSE 25 lbs in 4 months.
              <br>

          </div>

            <div class="second">
            <h3>Goal #1</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>Now let's set a smaller goal that's easier to reach. If you just focus on your end goal then you might get
                lost a long the way if you don't see results fast enough. So by having smaller goals, they fuel us into pushing
                ourselves more and more. That feeling of accomplishment after meeting a goal is really one of the most important
                factors in helping us complete our journey.
                <br>
                <br>
                Personally, I'd like to gain flexibility to where I can bend down and touch my toes. So my goal will be to touch my toes
                and hold that position for 60 seconds without too much discomfort. I recommend choosing something feasible for this goal.
                Something that's not too far out or will surprise you by taking longer than expected.
                <br>
                <br>
                Goal #1: Forward bend to touch toes. Holding for 60 seconds. Time: 2 weeks!
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Why 2 weeks?</h4>
                <br>

                This part relies on you. You know your body better than anyone so I won't be able to tell you how long to set your time limit
                to. If you're starting out then I'd say think of a time limit and add a little bit more on to it, just to be safe.
              </p>

            <div class="third">
              <h3>Goal #2</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>So this is going to be a simpler goal. For this one I want you to choose a weight and a date you'd like to hit that weight at.
                For example, I'm starting out wanting to lose weight so I'd like to lose about 3 pounds by the end of week 2. I recommend staying between
                3-5 lbs just because you'll be surprised at how much weight you'll lose if you stick to your diet for 2 weeks. I use the 2 week
                period to tell:
                <br>
                <br>
                1) If my diet is working.
                  <li>If not then I need to adjust this through nutrition or excercise</li>
                  <br>
                2) How far did I progress?</p>
