<h3>How should I setup my plans for success?</h3>

<p>In order for us to be successful we need to setup a plan that will be our blueprint for Fat Loss. Initially, we need to declare our goals. What are we trying to do?
  How much weight are we trying to lose? Do we want to live a healthier life? Do we want to eat clean or healthier food? Once we know our goals then we can work on Nutrition
  and Exercise.</p>

  <h3>Let's plan out our Meals</h3>

  <p>Before we plan out our meals we need to know how many Calories and Macronutrients we need to eat. We cover how to calculate your daily Calorie Intake and
    individual Macronutrients <a href="macros.html">here</a>!<br>

    This is important because we can figuure out how much we need to eat per day in order to lose fat. The way we structure our meals really depends on your daily lifestyle.
    People vary in how many meals they eat and when they eat it. We'll follow a simple structure that's easy to follow.<br>

    We structure our meals into Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner then add snacks in between to curb hunger. Here's an example of our daily meals:
    <br>

    <div class="well">

      <h3><b>Breakfast</b>: 8:00 AM</h3>
      <p>1 Packet of Oatmeal with Water or Milk<br>
      1 Egg and 2 Servings of Liquid Egg Whites<br>
      4 strips of Turkey bacon<br>
      <br>
      Water</p>
      <br>

      <h3><b>Snack #1</b>: 11:30 AM</h3>
      <p>Banana with 1 serving of Peanut Butter<br><br>
        OR<br><br>
        Protein Shake with 2 servings of Protein Powder<br><br>

        Granola Bar or FiberOne Bar<br>
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3><b>Lunch</b>: 3:00 PM</h3>
      <p>Pan Fried Chicken Breast made with 1/2 serving of Olive Oil (1 serving of Olive Oil has around 17g of Fat)<br>
        Baked Sweet Potato<br>
        Green Beans<br>
        White Potato<br>
        <br>
        Water</p>

        <h3><b>Snack #2</b>: 6:00 PM</h3>
        <p>Protein Shake with 1-2 servings of Protein Powder<br>
          1 Cup of Water</p>

        <h3><b>Dinner</b>: 9:00 PM</h3>
        <p>Ground beef made with Pam Spray<br>
          Baked Sweet Potatoe<br>
          1/2 cup of Rice<br>
        </p>


    </div>

    <p>This is just an example of the meals we'd eat that day. The main point of this is that by structuring your meals and knowing what we'll be eating the day or week before, we don't have
      to spend time thinking about what we should eat. And in that time thinking, we're more likely to get something like fast food as it's quicker and easier to prepare than a meal. This is
      why we recommend planning your meals in such a way so we will be able to know what we're eating, how much we're eating, when we're eating, and won't be tempted to eat fast food.</p>

      <h3> Let's plan exercise!</p>

        <p>Incorporating exercise is totally up to you. We recommend exercising because it'll help you reach your goals much faster and help you live a healtheir life. We talk more about how exercise
          is important <a href="exercise.html">here</a>. So in order to really get the benefits of exercising we need to be consistent. Just going for a week or two won't help, and doing that will lead
          to forming bad habits. However, we don't recommend you to just jump into it though. In order to consistently go to the gym or do anything you set your mind to, we have to make good habits.</p>

          <p>We won't talk about what you should specifically do to workout in this section, but we will have a section for specific routines and exercises in the near future.</p>
